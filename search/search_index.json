The 2 most prominent members joined a rival faction, Internet Explorers, enticed with offers from Hades and his crew, while the owner, Jack, who himself had separated from the IE chose to abandon his quest for glory. He swore on revenge - that IE shall fall before the might of potassium, but for now, he must rebuild the foundations elsewhere.  What must be done with the base? It shall provide sanctuary to all needy travellers and new players, offering them sustenance and lending them a helping hand.

Hades joined the server on <code>December 25, 2023</code> at the very start of Season 3.  Some of his notable achievements include : 1. He practically founded the <code>Dragon Slayers</code> base on a cliffside near <code>Lockheed Martin</code> (LM) base of DRON. The nation of DRON prospered with DS and LM as its capitals.  2. He became arguably one of the richest on the server in terms of valuables (diamonds, netherite, ancient debris, elytras etc.). 3. He has created multiple farms, like the Raid Farm, redesigned the trading hall at the <code>Notre Dame</code> (ND) base of DRON, and much more.  4. In Season 4, he created the IE faction, and it very soon became a replica of DRON (almost) paralleling his old faction in terms of riches and self-sufficiency.</p> <p>Goofs: He has spent 7 hours of real-life time to trap a zombie for his iron farm (it broke after 2 minecraft days).</p>"},{"location":"players/hades/#other-details","title":"Other Details","text":"<p>Hades lives in India, and he is around 17-18 years old.

While DRON boasted the largest members, SKP's diligence and incomparable hours of game-time brought SF to the level of self-sufficiency and war. When war came, well, it lasted exactly 30 minutes (a massive meme for days to come), and SF faced a humiliating defeat. SKP however was adamant to never yield to LeUnium's faction, and even in Season 4, he upholds the rivalry. SKP created the Aerial Empire, refusing to join any ex-DRON member. He is, however, friendly in-game, generous to new players of his faction and of rivals as well.  According to an insider, SKP named his faction \"Salmon Faction\" when he noticed he had a salmon in his inventory.  SKP fkin hates iSark (who is writing this wiki page about him) because he may or may not have made fun of SF, himself being a part of DRON. Hence, SKP has scandalously denied multiple requests to join AE (Aerial Empire) in Season 4. SKP joined the server on January 13, 2024, and his first 2 messages were : \"mhm / whats the ip?\". Blind to the fact that \"the ip\" was LITERALLY on top of his message,he was met with an exasperated ham replying with \"r e a d  \u2060\ud83d\udcda\u30fbinfo  g o d d a m i t\". Recently (March 7, 2024), he has been accused of using x-ray hacks, but all charges were dropped for lack of evidence.</p> <p>Side Note : Just so the author of this wiki does not get mauled by him tonight, SF surrendered to DRON in 30 minutes of war because : 1. It was based on punching, and 2. SF had few members online (2-3) compared to DRON's 8-9 members.</p>"},{"location":"players/itzskp/#other-details","title":"Other Details","text":"<p>SKP lives in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh.
