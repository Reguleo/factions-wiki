##### :material-account-question: About
Hades was an important member in DRON (Democratic Republic of Noxus) and the current leader of the Internet Explorers. 
Hades joined the server on `December 25, 2023` at the very start of Season 3. 
Some of his notable achievements include :
1. He practically founded the `Dragon Slayers` base on a cliffside near `Lockheed Martin` (LM) base of DRON. The nation of DRON prospered with DS and LM as its capitals. 
2. He became arguably one of the richest on the server in terms of valuables (diamonds, netherite, ancient debris, elytras etc.).
3. He has created multiple farms, like the Raid Farm, redesigned the trading hall at the `Notre Dame` (ND) base of DRON, and much more. 
4. In Season 4, he created the IE faction, and it very soon became a replica of DRON (almost) paralleling his old faction in terms of riches and self-sufficiency.

***Goofs:*** He has spent 7 hours of real-life time to trap a zombie for his iron farm (it broke after 2 minecraft days).

##### :material-lead-pencil: Other Details
Hades lives in India, and he is around 17-18 years old. He studies in the 12th grade. He also has severe hormonal tendencies, as is evident from recent images in the hall of shame.
