## ðŸ—¿ History of the Greenies

### Seasons 1-2

The Greenies originally began in Season 1, with the original creator, Derpsion, being the leader. The faction had a primary emphasis on trading and selling goods, and during the second season, it had even made its own form of currency of green dye from cacti. The name "Greenies" was chosen because of Derpsion's favorite color. Eventually, with the end of Season 2, the Greenies was dissolved as a result of the new policy that required all factions to dissolve at the end of a season. As well as this, the Greenies were also dissolved due to a general inactivity of members, and Derpsion had become less and less active. 

### Season 3

After a while after Season 3 had started, Reguleo, who had recently come back from a period of inactivity, had rejoined the server. After trying (and failing) to create a sustainable faction, Reguleo had wanted to find a new place where he would call home and maybe establish a new, peaceful faction. After sailing around for a while trying to find a place to establish his base, he found Targaros' cherry island. Inspired, he decided to create a faction. Eventually, Reguleo convinced his old teammate SparkSteel8 and the original leader Derpsion to join his new faction. Like the original, the newly created faction would focus on trading and exporting items. The faction's motto was "Fierce heart, fearless mind."

The leaders at the time were Reguleo, Derpsion, and SparkSteel8, making up the high ranking "Council". Eventually, near the end of Season 3, Targaros was promoted to the position and Derpsion retired of his powers as Council-member (partially due to his inactivity).

After a while, the faction had become quite established. A new member at the time, [Aji](staff/aji.md) decided to join the faction as well. Meanwhile, Targaros had set out to create a clock tower that would serve as the main base of the Greenies, housing the team's nether portal, various chests, as well as the faction's valued music reserves. Targ, being the main builder of the faction, had also helped to establish several members' bases, namely Reguleo's house and Fraderz's house. She also helped to make the Greenies sponsored V.A.P.E shop, which would have state-of-the-art smoking facilities. It was immediately a hit at the shopping district. In addition to this, she also made a Fireworks and Gunpowder shop, which was mainly supplied with gunpowder and paper from the faction's respective farms.

In the meantime, Aji was getting well established as well, setting up her Cherry Kingdom. However, she decided to leave the Greenies and joined DRON instead, as a result of continued friendship with many DRON members. However, she kept her base free and open to all Greenie members, also a sign of her continued partnership with her former faction. 

The Greenies were closely allied with DRON, with the two factions sharing each other's farms and cooperating. Greenie members were always allowed within DRON territory, and Targ worked closely with DRON to help flesh out their LM base location. 

At the end of Season 3, the Greenies had ammassed around 10-15 members, making it one of the larger factions. 

### Season 4 (Present day)

At the start of Season 4, Reguleo decided to rebrand and restructure the Greenies, renaming the faction to "Greenie Company". It was a throwback to his old faction he had created, the Venevian Company, before the start of the Greenies in Season 3. Reguleo established the official Greenies base on a small spruce island, and the base was rapidly expanded by Fraderz and SparkSteel8. Targaros however, decided not to rejoin the faction.

The base is still a work in progress, but recent business deals with the [Areial Empire](factions/ae.md) has rapidly expedited that process.

## Achievements

The Greenies had amassed a decent fortune in terms of wealth (in diamonds, netherite, and other rare items) in Season 3. In addition to this, there was a villager breeder, a sugar cane farm, a gunpowder farm, and a super smelter. Serving as the main base to the Greenies, there was the clock tower, which was built by Targaros. Smaller player bases include Reguleo's oak house, Fraderz's spruce house, and Nedya's starter house (which was later repurposed as SparkSteel8's home). In season 4, a well established dock as well as Reguleo's spruce house has been made. SparkSteel also has a house. A few sales of andesite to the Areial Empire has also helped increase the Greenies material wealth to several stacks of iron and diamonds.
